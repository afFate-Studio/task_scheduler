# task_scheduler

Just making this project for fun, using this project to learn as much as possible.

Looking forward to the learning process, and all of the lessons that come along with it.

once this terminal project is done I'm going to make a GUI version to continue to test myself

if you have any questions or perhaps a better way of implementing something I'm always open to listening.


how to run this program:

pip install -r requirements.txt

to save time, if you have a file to provide the following information in the initialize.ini
full_file_path
your_email (gmail)

python main.py
or python3 main.py
